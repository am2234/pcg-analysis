## Introduction

This repository contains algorithms to analyse the signal quality of segmented phonocardiogram (PCG) signals and calculate signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).

For examples of the code, please see the `scripts` folder. The script `example_snr.py` loads an example heart sound series and corresponding segmentation, and then calculates an SNR. The script `plot_example_snr.py` plots the step-by-step process of calculating the SNR for the same example signal.

This code supports the publication *'A flexible multi-sensor device enabling handheld sensing of heart sounds by untrained users'* ([Medxriv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.09.24315183v1)).
